'''When editing a Wikipedia article, you can create a bulleted list 
by putting each list item on its own line and placing a star in front. 
But say you have a really large list that you want to add bullet points to. 
You could just type those stars at the beginning of each line, one by one. 
Or you could automate this task with a short Python script.'''

#! /usr/bin/env python3
# bulletPointAdder.py - Adds Wikipedia bullet points to the start
# of each line of text on the clipboard.

import pyperclip

text=pyperclip.paste()
#seperate lines
lists=text.split("\n")
#add stars
for lis in range(len(lists)):
    lists[lis]="* "+lists[lis]

#join the list into a string    
text="\n".join(lists)
pyperclip.copy(text)
